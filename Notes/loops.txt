for creating table

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(`Outer loop value: ${i}`)
    for (let j = 0; j <= 10; j++) {
        // console.log(`Inner loop value: ${j} and outer loop ${i}`) 
        console.log(i + ' * ' + j + ' = ' + i * j)
    }
    
}


don't use loops without ++ with index
like this  for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i)
that is consumes more memory in your system 
many time this was hanged up



// break and continue
break get stopped every thing
but 
continue is skip the process one time then run again 



while Array


let myArray = ["cap","iron","Thor"]

let arr = 0 // for increment decrement
while (arr < myArray.length) {
    console.log(`value is ${myArray[arr]}`);
    arr++    
}
