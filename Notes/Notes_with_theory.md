## Variables
Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data. JavaScript allows the usage of variables in the following three ways:

1. **var**	    Used to initialize to value, redeclared and its value can be reassigned.	
2. **let**	    Similar to var but is block scoped	
3. **const**	Used to declare a fixed value that cannot be changed.	

## Datatypes

1. **Number**	Numeric values can be real number or integers.  
***var x= number;***
2. **String**	Series of multiple characters written in quotes.  
***var x= “characters”;***
3. **Boolean**	Has only two values true or false.	var x= true/false;
4. **Null**	Special value that represents that the variable is empty.  
***var x= null;***
5. **Undefined**	Represents a variable which is declared but not assigned any value.	  
***let x; / let x= undefined;***
6. **Object**	Complex data type that allows us to store a collection of data.	  
***var x= {  
    key: “value”;  
    key: “value”;  
}***
7. **Array**	Stores multiple values of same type in a single variable.  
***var x =[‘y1’, ‘y2′,’y3′,’y4’];
y: any datatype***

8. **Function**	Functions are objects that can be called to execute a block of code.  
**function x(arguments){
    block of code
}**

## Operators

1. **Arithmetic**	Used to perform basic arithmetic operations on variables(operands).   
**+,-,*,/,%,++,–**
2. **Comparison**	used to compare two operands.  
**==, ===,!=,>,<,>=,<=**
3. **Bitwise**	Used to perform bitwise operations.	**&, | , ^,~,<<, >>, >>>**
4. **Logical**	
There are three logical operators in javascript.

4.1. **logical AND:** When all the operands are true.
4.2. **logical OR:** When one or more than one operands are true.
4.3. **logical NOT:** Converts true to false.
exp1&&exp2,exp1 ||exp2, !exp
5. **Assignment**	Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.	=, +=,-=,*=,/=,%=
